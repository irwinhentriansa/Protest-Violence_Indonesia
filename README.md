See all of above counting plot, its tell us for each *protest* had happened otherwise most of event accurately by reported times furthermore the exact location happened in a spesific places recorded as a longitude and latitude then described by Location, Admin1, Admin2, Admin3, Longitude, Latitude. Tiny amount of event has happened in a wide/opened area such as border area, forest, sea, etc.

<p align = 'right' style="text-align:right">The reported event was made by an reporter or official announcement, due to the highest count number of that, obviously that if a stake holder want to open any news or media business that company must be accountable first and ready to gather an valid information 24 hours a day. Accountability and integrated system of stake holder's who want open kind of business must be worthy enough to reckoned.<p><hr>

2. **Who is the most actor who involved at the event ?**

Those are The actor who joined in event most of them are `Protester` which acted as a *peaceful protest* almost 1600 made an event. Should take a look what kind of protest are they and then when or how much was it happened? How much `fatalities` taken? What kind sub event that specified its event? who is `assoc_actor_1` take a part of event?

3. **When and How much was it happened by them ?**

There was a special times during an 4 years window, its December 19-2016/2017

4. **By whom those high 20 event created in a single time? It should be represented by `assoc_actor_1`. Let's take a look!**

Since on the most event created in single one date, The Issues lead that protest are words above. Maybe there are such an sensitive policies bother them.

5. **What kind of specified name of organization that involved in the all event ?**

<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61248667/93964474-db4fac00-fd89-11ea-8680-cc9f48b5417d.png' style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width = 600 height = 550" />

Most of Protests happened by Labour Group ans Students. Policies must be reconsidered again by *Government* to prevent an high event which created by them and Papuan Ethnic Group followed by Muslim Group.

Those names appears then created an protest event lead by a mistaken from policies that have been created. Reconsidering policies that thought to be harmful for each groups is a better way to prevent a protest.

6. **General Issues**
